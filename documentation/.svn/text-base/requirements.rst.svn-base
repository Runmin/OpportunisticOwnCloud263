Requirements for OpportunisticOwnCloud
======================================

.. _phone

We have developed OpportunisticOwnCloud to target Android SDK 17 (Jelly Bean). The minimum requirement is
Android SDK 8 (Froyo). We have run OOC successfully on systems running Froyo and Gingerbread. 

.. _webdav_server
WebDAV Server
-------------

While OOC should be able to interface with any WebDAV server using the Sardine library, we recommend installing
and running an ownCloud server instance to use with OOC. See `<http://owncloud.org/install/>`.

*DEVELOPERS ONLY*

In order to contribute to OOC, you must have Android ADT. We recommend downloading it from 
`here<http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html`_ as this provides the entire Android SDK, 
including Eclipse with ADT plugins.
